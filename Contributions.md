# Contributing to FIMS

The purpose of hosting FIMS as a public open-source project on Github is to enable a broad communinity to make contributions to FIMS while maintaining a controlled and stable core. For example, one aim of FIMS is to expand the range of services available and a great way to do this is to encourage users to add their own.  

Contribtions to FIMS are expected to be in one of four categories, where each is described in a section below:

* addition;
* fix;
* derivative;
* related.

Please do fork the FIMS project. To communicate with the FIMS membership and administrators, please raise issues using the github issues system or create a pull request.

### Addition

Use case:

> A company has been developing FIMS-like adapters for years and decides to have a project to share these with the wider community. It takes a fork of FIMS v1.2, adds in its extra services taking care to ensure compatibility with FIMS and makes a pull request to the FIMS architecture council.  At the same time it submits an AMWA IPR contribution form. The FIMS architecture council thinks the changes are appropriate and merges them onto a branch of the core FIMS project. These are merged with other significant changes and become part of the v1.3 FIMS review cycle and make it into FIMS v1.3. 

### Fix

Use case:

> An individual notices a bug in v1.2 of FIMS or spots a minor incremental change of significant benefit. They create a fork, make the fix and make a pull request to the architecture council. The architecture council accept the change as a minor, non breaking fix and merge it directly onto the master branch, incrementing the tertiary version number, e.g. creating FIMS v1.2.1.

### Derivative

Use case:

> A company (e.g. “Acme”) is developing their own FIMS-like SOA system for the management of media assets within part of a larger supply chain. They would like to use some of the FIMS concepts but need to change the data models significantly to fit with their business model. They are happy to share their work openly, but to check their data model back into FIMS would break aspects of the professional media focus of FIMS - classing it as a derivative related project.

### Related

Use case: 

> Another organisation (e.g. “CBA”) builds on a forked project by creating a workflow message sequencer that can act like a simple orchestrator. Although taken from a fork that is not suitable for checking back into core FIMS and not part of the FIMS remit, the sequencer is a generally useful utility and so the FIMS group is made aware of it and classes it is a related project of interest. Such a project might be considered as a separate specification through the AMWA RFC process.

## Code of conduct

FIMS is a broad international community of professionals and enthusiasts working in the media and entertainment industry. FIMS has an active user base and communications are expected to be respectful and reasonable. Constructive suggestions, bug reports, requests for changes and polite criticisms are welcome. Disrespectful messages, rudeness, self-promotional material and other forms of abuse are not welcome and will not be tolerated.
