# FIMS v1.3 - FIMS test subgroup branch

This repository contains the version 1.3 release of the [EBU](http://tech.ebu.ch)/[AMWA](http://www.amwa.tv) 
[Framework for Interoparable Media Services (FIMS)](http://www.fims.tv). The specification has been approved 
by both sponsoring organisations.

## FIMS Overview

FIMS is a vendor-neutral common framework for implementing Interoperable Media Services using a Service 
Oriented Architecture (SOA) based system for use in broadcast, production, post production, media distribution, 
and media archive applications. The framework supports interoperability, interchangeability and reusability of 
media specific services.

This framework covers the following system and management requirements: 

* service management, 
* awareness, 
* behaviour and communication, 
* content and time awareness.

This version of the specification addresses media services for capture, transform, transfer, repository and 
quality control, with support for partial content and servive capability description.
