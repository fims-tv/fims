# FIMS v1.3.1

This repository contains the version 1.3.1 release of the [EBU](http://tech.ebu.ch)/[AMWA](http://www.amwa.tv) 
[Framework for Interoparable Media Services (FIMS)](http://www.fims.tv). The specification has been approved 
by both sponsoring organisations.

## FIMS Overview

FIMS is a vendor-neutral common framework for implementing Interoperable Media Services using a Service 
Oriented Architecture (SOA) based system for use in broadcast, production, post production, media distribution, 
and media archive applications. The framework supports interoperability, interchangeability and reusability of 
media specific services.

This framework covers the following system and management requirements: 

* service management, 
* awareness, 
* behaviour and communication, 
* content and time awareness.

This version of the specification addresses media services for capture, transform, transfer, repository and 
quality control, with support for partial content and servive capability description.

## Significant updates

Three significant additions were made between v1.2 and v1.3 of the specification:

1. Extension of the FIMS repository interface.
2. Support for growing content in particular in the context of streaming over IP.
3. A new service interface for Automatic Metadata Extraction (AME).

## What's in the package

Technical specification is contained in the [`WSDL-REST-XSD`](./WSDL-REST-XSD) folder. Note that the REST documentation is embedded within the equivalent WSDL file.
