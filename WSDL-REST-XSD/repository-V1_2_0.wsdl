	<!-- **************************** services **************************** -->    
    <wsdl:portType name="Repository">
    	<wsdl:documentation>The Repository port is for operations that interact directly with the repository.
		Asynchronous operations are those that return "Ack" messages instead of "Response" messages.  If an asynchronous operation fails immediately, a Fault message will be returned instead of an Ack.  This can happen, for example, if the request is malformed, say with invalid credentials.  If the operation returns an Ack, then the result is returned via Notification.  As part of the Request, the caller may supply "Notify-To" and "Fault-To" endpoints to receive success or failure notifications.  If the endpoints are not supplied, then the caller will have no way of knowing when the request was finished, and whether it succeeded or failed.
		Cancel operations are a little different because they may succeed or fail depending on the system state.  If, for example, a PurgeEssence command has already permanently removed essence files, then an associated CancelPurgeEssence request will fail because there is no way to undo that action.  This failure may happen immediately or via fault notification, depending on the implementation and its ability to validate requests.

This operation can be used to register the intention to create essence, allowing other clients to adjust behavior accordingly.  When the actual essence is added to the repository, the placeholder returned from this call must be passed in with the AddEssence request.  Otherwise, the service cannot know which placeholder to remove, resulting in the simultaneous existence of a placeholder and actual essence.  The input placeholder essence locator is optional, unless a specific resource ID is desired for the placeholder.  If the placeholder is supplied, then the service will return the same placeholder in the response, preserving the resourceID.  If the placeholder is not supplied, the service will create a placeholder and return it in the response.</wsdl:documentation>

If a service implementation transfers the files from the accessible location to a different location, then the returned essence locator must reflect the new location(s) while preserving the resourceID.  Also, in this case the service implementation must remove the files from the accessible location.  This is an asynchronous operation.

AsyncEndpointType defines "replyTo" for Result notifications and "faultTo" for Fault notifications.  Event endpoint registration is implementation-specific, details to published at a later time.
