Welcome to FIMS V1.3

FIMS describes a vendor-neutral common framework for implementing Interoperable Media Services using a 
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based system, supporting interoperability, interchangeability and 
reusability of media specific services. 

The package includes information about the FIMS V1.3 interfaces. FIMS V1.3 adds the Automatic Metadata Extraction (AME) interface, 
as well an updated version of the FIMS repository interface.

The packages is divided into several sections:

1- WSDL-REST-XSD: This folder contains all the XSD and WSDL files for all interface types. Use these files 
within your implementation tools for contract-first development, domain model generation, payload validation. 

2- FIMS 1.3 Technical Specification - General Description: Document covering high-level of FIMS concepts: architecture, 
message patterns, media service management,…

3- API Documentation: This folder is divided into separate sub-folder representing the API technical specification 
details for each interface type:
     a- Repository: click on the file labeled START HERE.html to open the documentation.
     b- Transform: click on the file labeled START HERE.html to open the documentation.
